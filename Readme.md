# Synth-Finity

![Logo](Media/Logo.png)

 - Modular stands and organization system, designed around the Gridfinity base system.
   
    - Note: This system is designed primarily for mini and portable music gear (synths, grooveboxes, mixers, and utility devices). It is not recommended for full-size instruments or heavy equipment, as the stands and Gridfinity bases may not provide sufficient support.
